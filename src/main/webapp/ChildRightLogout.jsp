	<p style="font-size: 16px;">
		They are abandoned. They do not get a chance to step in a school. They
		are left to fend for themselves on the streets. They suffer from many
		forms of violence. They do not have access to even primary healthcare.
		They are subjected to cruel and inhumane treatments every day. They
		are children – innocent, young and beautiful – who are deprived of
		their rights.
		<br><br> In the history of human rights, the rights of children
		are the most ratified. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of
		the Child (UNCRC) defines Child Rights as the minimum entitlements and
		freedoms that should be afforded to every citizen below the age of 18
		regardless of race, national origin, colour, gender, language,
		religion, opinions, origin, wealth, birth status, disability, or other
		characteristics. These rights encompass freedom of children and their
		civil rights, family environment, necessary healthcare and welfare,
		education, leisure and cultural activities and special protection
		measures. <br>
		<br>The UNCRC outlines the fundamental human rights that should
		be afforded to children in four broad classifications that suitably
		cover all civil, political, social, economic and cultural rights of
		every child: 
		<br>
		<br>
		1. Right to Survival: <br>  Right to be born<br>
		 Right to minimum standards of food, shelter and clothing <br> 
		Right to live with dignity <br>  Right to health care, to safe
		drinking water, nutritious food, a clean and safe environment, and
		information to help them stay healthy <br>
		<br>
		2. Right to Protection:<br>
		 Right to be protected from all sorts of violence <br> Right to be
		protected from neglect <br> Right to be protected from physical and
		sexual abuse <br>
		<br>
		3. Right to be protected from dangerous drugs Right to
		Participation: <br> Right to freedom of opinion <br> Right to freedom of
		expression <br> Right to freedom of association <br> Right to information <br>
		Right to participate in any decision making that involves him/her
		directly or indirectly<br>
		<br>
		4. Right to Development: <br> Right to education <br>
		Right to learn <br> Right to relax and play <br> Right to all forms of
		development – emotional, mental and physical
