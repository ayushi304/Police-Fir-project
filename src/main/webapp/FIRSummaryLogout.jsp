What is an FIR?<br><br>
An FIR is a written document that is filed by the police
 when you are a victim of a cognizable offence, 
i.e. an offence for which police can take action without prior court approval (a warrant).
 Section 154 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 defines what amounts to first information. 
Examples include but are not limited to murder, rape, theft, insulting the modesty of women and kidnapping.
<br>
 <br>

Who can file an FIR?<br>
Anyone who is either a victim of a crime, or has witnessed a crime or has information regarding 
a crime may file an FIR.
<br>
<br> 

Where can an FIR be filed?<br><br>
An FIR must be filed at the police station closest to the location of the crime. 
No police station can refuse filing of an FIR.
 Please note that every police station has a jurisdictional area within which 
they may investigate offences and crimes committed.
<br>
 <br>

What is a Zero FIR?<br><br>
A Zero FIR allows for any police station to register an FIR, regardless of their jurisdictional area. 
 It is usually used for crimes such as murder and rape and other cognizable offences, 
i.e. an offence for which police can take action without prior court approval. 
Initial action and investigation is conducted before it is transferred to the appropriate
jurisdictional station as required. It is helpful for crimes that require immediate response as 
it allows for swifter action that is not bogged down by bureaucratic procedure as well as accounts for whether 
the police station under whose jurisdiction the crime was committed is not easily accessible.
<br>
<br> 

When can an FIR be filed?<br><br>
An FIR has to be filed immediately and any delay in reporting must be justified. 
The police officer must give you a copy of the FIR at no cost to you.
<br>
 <br>

Why should one file an FIR?<br><br>
An FIR is a very important document as it is one of the first steps towards justice for the wronged.
 Police take up investigation of the case only after registering the FIR in their respective police station.
<br>
 <br>

What is the procedure to file an FIR?<br>
<br>
The officer must record the FIR in writing;
The officer must read the FIR back to the person filing the FIR to ensure that all details are correct;
The person filing the FIR must sign the FIR; and
Once recorded, signed and registered, the person filing the FIR must get a copy of the FIR free of cost.
